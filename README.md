## 📜 About This Project

After successfully passing the CSWA-Simulation exam, I created this repository to share the materials and insights I gathered during my preparation. The goal is to provide a clear, structured, and helpful resource for other students and professionals aiming to achieve this certification.

This guide is built upon the curriculum of the "Become a SOLIDWORKS Simulation Associate Today!" course on Udemy and my personal study notes.

### ✨ Key Features

* **FEA Theory:** In-depth notes explaining the fundamental principles of Finite Element Analysis.
* **Solved Problems:** A collection of practice problems with step-by-step solutions and `.SLDPRT` files.
* **Quick Reference Sheets:** Condensed notes for last-minute review.
* **Curated Links:** A list of useful tutorials, articles, and official documentation.
