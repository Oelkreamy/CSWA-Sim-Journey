## 📜 About This Project

After successfully passing the CSWA-Simulation exam, I created this repository to share the materials and insights I gathered during my preparation. The goal is to provide a clear, structured, and helpful resource for other students and professionals aiming to achieve this certification.

This guide is built upon the curriculum of the "Become a SOLIDWORKS Simulation Associate Today!" course on Udemy and my personal study notes.
